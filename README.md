## Description
Welcome to the Github Themed 2025 new year Quotes Generator! This project was created with the intention of offering a fun and easy way to get random quotes in a Github-themed style. However, I must admit, this project was rushed due to time limitations, and I apologize if it looks unpolished. Despite the rush, I hope you find it enjoyable!

Please click the "Quotes" button to get a new quote each time.

## How It Works
This repository contains a simple frontend application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here’s how it works:

1. **HTML Structure**: 
   The structure consists of a simple container with a `textarea` element where the quotes will be displayed. This allows the user to view the quote in a text box.

2. **JavaScript Functionality**: 
   - When the user clicks the “Quotes” button, a JavaScript function is triggered that fetches a random quote from a predefined list.
   - The list contains various motivational and New Year-themed quotes.
   - These quotes are stored in an array, and each time the user clicks the button, a random quote from this array is displayed in the `textarea`.

3. **CSS Styling**: 
   The styling is minimalistic and adopts a Github-like theme with simple colors and layout. However, it might seem a bit rushed due to time constraints.

## Features
- **Random Quote Generator**: A simple button click will generate a new random quote every time.
- **Github-Themed Design**: Inspired by the Github interface for a familiar look and feel.
- **Confetti:** Click the quotes button to find out
